# **Python Stock Quote**  

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows for the CI/CD of a simple stock quote application with a Python-based web interface. Terraform provisions an EC2 instance, sets up a Datadog dashboard, and configures monitors with alerts sent to a Slack channel for proactive incident management.

## **Development Workflow**  

The `main` branch is protected, requiring all code changes to go through a **Pull Request (PR)**.  

### **Pull Request Actions**  

When a PR is created, GitHub Actions will automatically:  
- Run **automated tests** (`test_app.py`).  
- Perform a **SonarQube scan** using a self-hosted **SonarQube server on EC2**.  

### **Deployment Workflow**  

Once a PR is merged into `main`, a GitHub Actions workflow will:  
1. **Build and push** a Docker image to **Docker Hub**.  
2. **Pull the latest Docker image** on the **EC2 instance**.  
3. **Run the container** on the EC2 instance.

## **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**  

Terraform is used to:  
- Provision the required AWS resources, including an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance.
- Store sensitive information in `terraform.tfvars` (ignored by Git for security).  
- Set up **monitors, alerts, and a dashboard in Datadog** for proactive incident management.

## **Datadog Monitoring and Alerts**  

### **Monitors in Datadog**  
Datadog monitors track system performance and application health, ensuring early detection of potential issues.

### **Datadog Dashboard**  
The dashboard provides a centralized, real-time view of key system resource utilization and the status of configured monitors.

### **Alert Notifications**  
When a Datadog monitor detects a breach of defined thresholds, an alert is triggered and displayed on the dashboard, providing immediate visual feedback.

At the same time, an alert is sent to a designated Slack channel, ensuring that the development and operations teams are promptly informed of any critical issues requiring attention.

### **Issue Recovery Notification**  
Once the issue is resolved and the system returns to a healthy state, Datadog sends a recovery message to the Slack channel:
