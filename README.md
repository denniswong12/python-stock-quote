## Development Workflow  
The `main` branch is protected, requiring all code changes to go through a **Pull Request (PR)**.  

### Pull Request Actions  
When a PR is created, GitHub Actions will automatically:  
- Run **automated tests** (`test_app.py`)  
- Perform a **SonarQube scan** using a self-hosted **SonarQube server on EC2**  

### Deployment Workflow  
Once a PR is merged into `main`, another GitHub Actions workflow will:  
- **Build and push** a Docker image to **Docker Hub**  
- On the **EC2 instance**, **pull the latest Docker image** from **Docker Hub**  
- **Run the container** on the EC2 instance
